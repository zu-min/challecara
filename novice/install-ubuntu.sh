Make sure that all works well by running the application generator command:         
    $ rails new railsgirls                                                       
                                                                                 
If you encounter the message:                                                    
    The program 'rails' is currently not installed.                              
                                                                                 
It is just a hiccup with the shell, solutions:                                   
    $ source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm                                                  
    Allow login shell, example http://rvm.io/integration/gnome-terminal/"
